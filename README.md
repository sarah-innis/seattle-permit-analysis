# Analyzing New Residential Construction in the City of Seattle
The aim of this project is to answer the following research questions on new residential construction in the City of Seattle:
- How is the housing supply changing within Seattle?
- Where is new housing being added?
- Are Seattle City Council Districts impacted differently by housing additions?
- As the population grows, how do we expect the number of large multifamily buildings per resident to change?

The goal of this analysis is to inform how Council Districts in Seattle are experiencing densification and to determine whether the number of multifamily buildings available per resident is declining. This analysis can be used to determine what key actions areas in the Seattle housing crisis are.
